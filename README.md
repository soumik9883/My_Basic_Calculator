# My_Basic_Calculator
In this small project based on a basic calculator, I have basically built a simple web-view calculator. For this particular project, I especially used HTML and CSS. And this basic calculator application designed to perform simple arithmetic calculations. It allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on numerical values.
